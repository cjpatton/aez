An implementation of AEZv3, an authenticated encryption scheme designed by 
Viet Tung Hoang, Ted Krovetz, and Phil Rogaway. AEZ is a submission in the 
CAESAR crypto competition. Written by Chris Patton <chrispatton@gmail.com> 
for the public domain in the hopes that it will be useful. 

  The code builds for three different architectures: 32-bit x86 (default), 
64-bit x86, and 64-bit x86 with support for AES-NI. For example, to build 
benchmarks for AES-NI, do 

  $ make bm arch=aes-ni 

To build for 64-bit systems, use `arch=x64`. Running `make` without this
argument defaults to 32-bit. 

  This directory also contains a simple wrapper for Python based on Ctypes.
First build a shared library and add it to the library path. On Linux: 
  
  $ make lib arch=aes-ni 
  $ sudo cp libaez.so /usr/local/lib
  $ sudo ldconfig

Next, Install the wrapper: 
  
  $ sudo python setup.py install 

It should now be accesible in Python:

  $ python
  >>> import aez
  >>> K = 'This is a key.'; N = 'This is a nonce.'
  >>> A = ['This', 'is', ('some', 'fancy'), 1.61803, 'data.']
  >>> C = aez.Encrypt('Hello, world!', K, N, A, abytes=7)
  >>> repr(C)
  "'\\x8f\\xed\\xdf\\x19\\xa5eY\\xb1\\xd8\\xd2{^\\x89\\x1e\\xdcZ\\xf8\\x95\\xb8]'"
  >>> aez.Decrypt(C, K, N, A, abytes=7)
  'Hello, world!'
